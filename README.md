# Localization & Mapping through ROS #
### @Politecnico di Milano, Academic Year 2021-2022 ###
The aim of this second robotics project was to develop a comprehensive localization and mapping system for a robot.
#### Project Components: ####
- **Localization and Mapping**: The project aimed to implement a localization and mapping system, involving the creation and maintenance of a map of the robot's environment and accurate determination of the robot's position within the map.
- **Launch Files Configuration**: Configuration of launch files, including AMCL for localization and Gmapping for map creation, with careful parameter tuning.
- **Map Creation**: Creation of maps using the Gmapping algorithm based on data from a bag file. Generated map files were stored for further use.
- **RVIZ Configuration**: RVIZ configuration for real-time visualization of robot localization and mapping, ensuring a proper display for the project's scenario.
- **TF Tree Visualization**: An image of the TF tree was provided to visualize and debug transformation frames, aiding in understanding the robot's coordinate transformations.
- **Multiple Data Sources**: Utilization of visual odometry, IMU data, and scout odometry as reliable data sources for localization, enhancing accuracy in determining the robot's position and orientation.
- **Bag Files**: Specific bag files were used for map creation, testing, and localization to evaluate the system's performance.
- **Execution Commands**: Detailed instructions for launching various components, such as Gmapping and localization nodes, provided a clear and user-friendly setup for project testing and operation.
